# Using agents

This is an agent specifically optimized for doing retrieval when necessary and also holding a conversation.

To start, we will set up the retriever we want to use, and then turn it into a retriever tool. Next, we will use the high level constructor for this type of agent. Finally, we will walk through how to construct a conversational retrieval agent from components.

# Retriever Tool

Now we need to create a tool for our retriever. The main things we need to pass in are a name for the retriever as well as a description. These will both be used by the language model, so they should be informative.

# Agent Constructor

Here, we will use the high level create_openai_tools_agent API to construct the agent.

Notice that beside the list of tools, the only thing we need to pass in is a language model to use. Under the hood, this agent is using the OpenAI tool-calling capabilities, so we need to use a ChatOpenAI model.

Notice that the follow up question asks about information previously retrieved, so no need to do another retrieval
