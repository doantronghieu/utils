In the previous chapter, you learned how to create efcient REST API endpoints to make predictions 
with trained machine learning models. Tis approach covers a lot of use cases, given that we have 
a single observation we want to work on. In some cases, however, we may need to continuously 
perform predictions on a stream of input – for instance, an object detection system that works in real 
time with video input. Tis is exactly what we’ll build in this chapter. How? If you remember, besides 
HTTP endpoints, FastAPI also has the ability to handle WebSockets endpoints, which allow us to 
send and receive streams of data. In this case, the browser will send into the WebSocket a stream of 
images from the webcam, and our application will run an object detection algorithm and send back 
the coordinates and label of each detected object in the image. For this task, we’ll rely on Hugging 
Face, which is both a set of tools and a library of pretrained AI models
